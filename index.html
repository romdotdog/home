    <h1>rom</h1>
    I have been programming since 2013 Â± 1 year.
    <h2>tell me about programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm really into <strong>TypeScript</strong> (since 2017) and <strong>Rust</strong> (since 2020). I've used them for a bunch of cool projects, like building compilers and scalable web apps.</li>
        <li>I'm also really good at writing <strong>Python</strong> (since 2015), <strong>C#</strong> (since 2015), and <strong>Lua</strong> (since 2014).</li>
        <li>There are some languages I haven't used as much, but I can easily make something with, like <strong>C/C++</strong> (since 2020), <strong>Java</strong> (since 2021), and <strong>PHP</strong> (since 2019).</li>
        <li>I love creating optimization-heavy code and leveraging async programming, especially with Rust and its ecosystems like tokio and hyper.</li>
        <li>I usually build neat web apps with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, but I've also used <strong>Solid.js</strong>, <strong>Svelte</strong>, and <strong>Astro</strong></li>
        <li>On the backend, I use <strong>Node.js</strong> for all of my projects, but I have experience with <strong>Flask</strong> too. I use databases like <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I've written everything from email servers to decentralized apps.</li>
        <li>I've built smart contracts with <strong>Solidity</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong> on <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Solana</strong>.</li>
        <li>Cryptography is definitely something I love to play around with. I've implemented everything from elliptic-curve cryptosystems to blockchain prototypes using zk-STARKS and VRFs/VDFs.</li>
        <li>I love working with <strong>WebAssembly</strong>, both compiling to it and writing host/glue code to make it work.</li>
        <li>I've used <strong>WebRTC</strong> an unusual amount. It can be a pain if you don't have a good understanding of it.</li>
        <li>I enjoy experimenting with LLMs and AI, designing intuitive interfaces for music discovery, language translation, and as a creativity aide.</li>
    </ul>
